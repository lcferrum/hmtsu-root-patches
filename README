Root patches based on HMTsu

2. About
--------
This is a collection of root patches for various Harmattan apps. Patches add
separate launch icon (.desktop file) for the selected app that launches it with
root privileges using HMTsu. The way it will be launched depends on whether app
was installed using trusted origin (with incept, aegis-install or in open mode
with "AEGIS_FIXED_ORIGIN=com.nokia.maemo") and what user substitute tools are
available.

3. Where to get
---------------
You can build .deb packages by yourself (refer to 'Building' section) or 
download ready-made patches from Sourceforge:

	https://sourceforge.net/projects/hmtsu/files/hmtsu-root-patches/
	
Main project homepage is at GitHub:

	https://github.com/lcferrum/hmtsu-root-patches

4. Usage
--------
Install .deb file with patch on your device (don't forget to allow installation
from non-Store sources in the Settings and install HMTsu beforehand). New
"rooted" launch icon will appear on your application screen. Use this icon to
launch corresponding app with root priveleges using HMTsu.

If you have added/removed user substitute tools, reinstalled target app to use
trusted to origin - just reapply the patch so that HMTsu launch method will be
adjusted to new environment.

5. Building
-----------
The easiest way to build each of the patches is by using MeeGo 1.2 Harmattan
Platform SDK provided by Nokia. Just make sure that you have installed Platform
SDK correctly, start scratchbox, select HARMATTAN_ARMEL target, switch to one
of the patch directories and type:

	dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

You can also use other means of building .deb packages but they are not
supported by the current distribution.
