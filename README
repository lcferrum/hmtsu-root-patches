The easiest way to build each of the patches is by using MeeGo 1.2 Harmattan
Platform SDK provided by Nokia. Just make sure that you have installed Platform
SDK correctly, start scratchbox, select HARMATTAN_ARMEL target, switch to one
of the patch directories and type:

	dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

You can also use other means of building .deb packages but they are not
supported by the current distribution.
